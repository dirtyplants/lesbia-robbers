CHANGES or CORRECTIONS

p.3: Just above Q4 in the section "Description of original observation": the last digit of the coordinates should be seconds unit mark, resembling double quotes ("), instead of the minutes unit mark (currently there).

p.6: Figure 1 caption ... frequency of LESBIA species." Lesbia is a generic epithet and should be italicized.

p.7: Table 1 caption ... for LESBIA spp." Lesbia is a generic epithet and should be italicized.
